# Accessible audio hardware

You may be worried about buying a new piece of technology, but not knowing if you will be able to use it. In the age of touchscreens, not every device on the market can be used reliably by people with visual impairments. This makes it all the more important to help each other and share knowledge about which devices can be used and how.

On this page I list all the devices I can recommend, how accessible they are and which I have personally tested. You will also find information about the price, what I recommend it for and a link to buy it. 
*NOTE*: The prices are not updated regularly, they reflect the status of my last check and may therefore vary.
I would also like to point out that the links are affiliate links. This means that I get a commission if you buy one of the products listed here through one of these links. There is no extra charge for you, you pay the normal price and you give me something back. Thank you in advance.

Of course, I am always available if you have any questions about any of the products, even before you buy, or if you need help with your decision. Please feel free to contact me via my {{% doc %}}contact page <contact>{{% /doc %}}.

                <td>The EVO series offers beginners and smaller studios an easy and affordable introduction to professional audio technology. These units may look plastic, but their inner values are what really shine. You will find excellent microphone preamps and easy-to-use software that works on both Windows and Mac with all common screen readers. The series ranges from the affordable EVO 4, with two mic/line inputs and outputs, to the EVO 16, with four inputs and outputs and various expansions via SPDIF/ADAT. On the software side, a stereo loopback channel and multiple submixes are always available, depending on the model.</td>

                <td>The Audient iD series is the higher quality and more comprehensive version of the EVO series. These are carefully crafted interfaces with an aluminium exterior that is better able to withstand transport and rough handling. Otherwise, they use the same microphone preamps as the EVO series, but scale from the iD 4, which has similar parameters to the EVO 4, to the iD 44, which offers significantly more ports than the EVO 16. In terms of software features, they are almost on a par with the EVO series, with only the Smart Gain function currently reserved for the EVO series. Stereo loopback and multiple submixes for flexible routing are also available.</td>
