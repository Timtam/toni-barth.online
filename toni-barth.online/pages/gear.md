# Accessible audio hardware

You may be worried about buying a new piece of technology, but not knowing if you will be able to use it. In the age of touchscreens, not every device on the market can be used reliably by people with visual impairments. This makes it all the more important to help each other and share knowledge about which devices can be used and how.

On this page I list all the devices I can recommend, how accessible they are and which I have personally tested. You will also find information about the price, what I recommend it for and a link to buy it. 
*NOTE*: The prices are not updated regularly, they reflect the status of my last check and may therefore vary.
I would also like to point out that the links are affiliate links. This means that I get a commission if you buy one of the products listed here through one of these links. There is no extra charge for you, you pay the normal price and you give me something back. Thank you in advance.

Of course, I am always available if you have any questions about any of the products, even before you buy, or if you need help with your decision. Please feel free to contact me via my {{% doc %}}contact page <contact>{{% /doc %}}.

    <summary>Audio Interfaces</summary>
    
    <p>Audio interfaces are notorious for their lack of controls. Unlike traditional mixers, they usually have very few knobs and buttons and are mainly controlled by software. However, not all software is easy to use, so below is a list of audio interfaces that I have personally tested and found to be easy to use and generally recommendable.</p>

                <td>From 108 € to 500 €</td>
                <td>The EVO series offers beginners and smaller studios an easy and affordable introduction to professional audio technology. These units may look plastic, but their inner values are what really shine. You will find excellent microphone preamps and easy-to-use software that works on both Windows and Mac with all common screen readers. The series ranges from the affordable EVO 4, with two mic/line inputs and outputs, to the EVO 16, with four inputs and outputs and various expansions via SPDIF/ADAT. On the software side, a stereo loopback channel and multiple submixes are always available, depending on the model.</td>

These are carefully crafted interfaces with an aluminium exterior that is better able to withstand transport and rough handling. Otherwise, they use the same microphone preamps as the EVO series, but scale from the iD 4, which has similar parameters to the EVO 4, to the iD 44, which offers significantly more ports than the EVO 16. In terms of software features, they are almost on a par with the EVO series, with only the Smart Gain function currently reserved for the EVO series.

    <summary>Digital instruments</summary>

    <p>Digital instruments are used in conjunction with a PC or Mac to create music directly on the computer. However, the additional features and benefits of digital instruments are not always accessible. Keyboards, for example, come in all shapes and sizes. Many of them nowadays offer additional functions that go far beyond a traditional keyboard. Some of them are not easy to use, so the extra cost isn't always worth it. Native Instruments is the clear choice for accessibility. Their keyboards even have speech output. This list contains all the digital instruments I recommend, and why.</p>

Smooth, touch-sensitive knobs allow you to quickly and easily edit the parameters of various digital instruments, while clearly defined buttons allow you to control important functions such as start/stop, metronome, undo and more from the keyboard without having to switch to your PC/Mac. This keyboard is perfect for beginners, for those who travel a lot, but also as a control for Native Instruments' own browser functions, while using your professional electric piano for the actual playing of melodies.</td>

                <td>The A series is still the entry-level segment of Native Instruments' keyboards, but they are now a little more robust and the touch is a little closer to what you would expect from higher quality keyboards or even electric pianos. The most portable of the bunch is undoubtedly the A25, with its 25 keys, while the A61, with its 61 keys and length of around one metre, is no longer ideal for travelling. The A49, with its 49 keys, offers a good compromise between space and performance. However, the A series has no advantage over the M32 in terms of functions beyond the keys.</td>

Any experienced musician used to a real piano will probably want to look at this range of keyboards. Unfortunately, only the MK2 series of S series keyboards are currently available with speech output.

What makes this finger drum pad stand out is the presence of speech output for all the functions of the device, as it does not have a display. The presence of two pads for each type of drum also makes it easier to play rolls and adapt the pad to the musician's preferences. The larger version of this pad, the FGDP-50, has a display and therefore no speech output, which is why I cannot fully recommend it.</td>

    <summary>Handheld Recorders</summary>

    <p>Handheld recorders, once mainly used for interviews, are usually very compact devices that can be used to make high-quality recordings quickly and easily on the move. Nowadays, their recording quality is so good that they can be used not only for interviews, but also for ambience, band performances and concert recordings. However, with improved recording quality comes increased control, which can often only be found in complex menu structures that blind and visually impaired users have to memorize. Fortunately, there are devices that are easier to use than others, without sacrificing recording quality.</p>

It has no menus, which makes it very easy to use. It does not have a speaker, but can be monitored with headphones. Its shape and functionality make it ideal for atmospheric recording, interview situations and as a camera microphone, for which it comes with a hot shoe adapter. The microphone's design allows for a wide range of recordings. For example, stereo recordings can be made with a 90-degree and 120-degree panorama. Recording is done in 32-bit float on a micro-SD card, with 32-bit float technology ensuring that recordings are rarely clipping, and that too loud or too quiet parts of the recording can be easily recovered in post-production.</td>

The units allow a wide range of settings to be made directly on the device, with the menu structure fully voiced through the unit's built-in speaker or headphone output. The smallest unit, the H1Essential, has a 3.5mm jack for connecting external microphones, such as a lavalier, in addition to the built-in microphones. The H4Essential and H6Essential also have 2 and 4 XLR inputs respectively, so you can even use professional studio microphones. All units can also be used as audio interfaces on a PC/Mac/smartphone, providing a flexible recording solution for on-the-go recording.</td>

                <td>The LCT 440 Pure is a small and lightweight large diaphragm condenser microphone with a cardioid polar pattern, designed primarily for use with human speech. Being a large-diaphragm condenser microphone, it is very sensitive to noise, so I would only recommend it in reasonably well-isolated environments. In fact, it can do a lot more than just pick up speech though. I have already used the LCT 440 Pure to record acoustic guitars and was delighted with the results. The package also includes a leather carrying case, a shock-mount, a windscreen and a magnetic pop filter. The small size of the microphone and the pop filter require a little practice when speaking into them to avoid plosive sounds on the recording, but overall this microphone delivers very good performance at an unexpectedly low price. It is XLR-compatible, although it does require 48 volts of phantom power. However, the microphone's preamp does not require a lot of power, making it suitable for use with less powerful audio interfaces.</td>

It is ideal for all types of interview situations, outdoor miking and video recording. The transmitters can be worn on clothing or on the body and come with a built-in microphone, but can be supplemented with the lavalier microphones for even clearer recording. The lavalier microphones are extremely small and can be attached to clothing or directly to the body, for example in the hair. The small size makes them very discreet, and the wireless transmission means maximum freedom of movement. The transmitter and receiver come in a stylish leather case that doubles as a charging station for all three devices. On a single charge, the transmitters and receiver can record continuously for around 6 hours. The transmitters record in 32-bit, making it easy to save a potentially clipped recording afterwards. In addition, the transmitters can be connected to any type of microphone that has a 3.5mm jack. The set also includes software for controlling the various functions of the devices and managing the recordings. Unfortunately, the software is currently only accessible to screen readers using advanced techniques such as OCR and Object Navigator. Feel free to contact me for more information.</td>

                <td>The SM7B is a classic vocal microphone. It has been on the market for over 50 years and continues to impress with its special sound, but also with its low sensitivity to ambient noise. Dynamic microphones, of which the SM7B is one, are generally less sensitive to noise that is not directly in their pick-up area, making them suitable for use on stage or in complex environments. I use the SM7B in these difficult areas all the time, and it does an excellent job. The microphone comes with two different pop filters and is otherwise very bulky and heavy, which is why I recommend it mainly for studio use. The microphone does not require 48V phantom power but a powerful, low-noise mic preamp, which can sometimes lead to noisy recordings with weaker audio interfaces. Shure has a solution to this problem. For some time now, the SM7dB has been available, which is the SM7B with an integrated microphone preamp. This means that although 48V phantom power is required, no significant pre-amp is required. So if you are unsure, the SM7dB can provide the necessary reassurance. However, all of the audio interfaces I have listed on this website are capable of using the original SM7B with ease.</td>

This means that there are actually four microphones hidden inside the microphone, arranged in a very specific pattern. Recordings made with this microphone result in the Ambisonics format, which is a variant of 3D audio with a very realistic representation of positions in a room. These recordings are particularly suitable for scoring audio dramas or films, or simply for personal enjoyment. Recording requires an audio interface or recording device with at least 4 XLR inputs, such as the Zoom H6Essential. Dedicated plug-ins or software may also be required for further processing.
