# Accessible audio hardware

You may be worried about buying a new piece of technology, but not knowing if you will be able to use it. In the age of touchscreens, not every device on the market can be used reliably by people with visual impairments. This makes it all the more important to help each other and share knowledge about which devices can be used and how.

On this page I list all the devices I can recommend, how accessible they are and which I have personally tested. You will also find information about the price, what I recommend it for and a link to buy it. 
*NOTE*: The prices are not updated regularly, they reflect the status of my last check and may therefore vary.
I would also like to point out that the links are affiliate links. This means that I get a commission if you buy one of the products listed here through one of these links. There is no extra charge for you, you pay the normal price and you give me something back. Thank you in advance.

Of course, I am always available if you have any questions about any of the products, even before you buy, or if you need help with your decision. Please feel free to contact me via my {{% doc %}}contact page <contact>{{% /doc %}}.

    <summary>Audio Interfaces</summary>
    
    <p>Audio interfaces are notorious for their lack of controls. Unlike traditional mixers, they usually have very few knobs and buttons and are mainly controlled by software. However, not all software is easy to use, so below is a list of audio interfaces that I have personally tested and found to be easy to use and generally recommendable.</p>

                <td>Audient EVO Series</td>
                <td>From 108 € to 500 €</td>
                <td>The EVO series offers beginners and smaller studios an easy and affordable introduction to professional audio technology. These units may look plastic, but their inner values are what really shine. You will find excellent microphone preamps and easy-to-use software that works on both Windows and Mac with all common screen readers. The series ranges from the affordable EVO 4, with two mic/line inputs and outputs, to the EVO 16, with four inputs and outputs and various expansions via SPDIF/ADAT. On the software side, a stereo loopback channel and multiple submixes are always available, depending on the model.</td>

                <td>The Audient iD series is the higher quality and more comprehensive version of the EVO series. These are carefully crafted interfaces with an aluminium exterior that is better able to withstand transport and rough handling. Otherwise, they use the same microphone preamps as the EVO series, but scale from the iD 4, which has similar parameters to the EVO 4, to the iD 44, which offers significantly more ports than the EVO 16. In terms of software features, they are almost on a par with the EVO series, with only the Smart Gain function currently reserved for the EVO series. Stereo loopback and multiple submixes for flexible routing are also available.</td>

    <summary>Keyboards</summary>

    <p>Keyboards come in all shapes and sizes. These days, many offer extra features that go far beyond a simple keyboard. Not all of them are so easy to use that the extra cost is worth it. In this respect, Native Instruments stands out for its accessibility, as its keyboards even have speech output. In this list you will find all the keyboards I can recommend and why.</p>
    
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th style="width:20%">Device</th>

                <td>Native Instruments M32</td>
                <td>99 €</td>
                <td>This is the entry-level keyboard from Native Instruments. With 32 keys, it offers the perfect compromise between playability and portability. Smooth, touch-sensitive knobs allow you to quickly and easily edit the parameters of various digital instruments, while clearly defined buttons allow you to control important functions such as start/stop, metronome, undo and more from the keyboard without having to switch to your PC/Mac. This keyboard is perfect for beginners, for those who travel a lot, but also as a control for Native Instruments' own browser functions, while using your professional electric piano for the actual playing of melodies.</td>
                <td><a href="https://amzn.to/48oWWoP">M32 on Amazon</a></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Native Instruments A Series</td>
                <td>From 131 € to 219 €</td>
                <td>The A series is still the entry-level segment of Native Instruments' keyboards, but they are now a little more robust and the touch is a little closer to what you would expect from higher quality keyboards or even electric pianos. The most portable of the bunch is undoubtedly the A25, with its 25 keys, while the A61, with its 61 keys and length of around one metre, is no longer ideal for travelling. The A49, with its 49 keys, offers a good compromise between space and performance. However, the A series has no advantage over the M32 in terms of functions beyond the keys.</td>

                <td>1.099 €</td>
                <td>The largest keyboard from Native Instruments, packed with features and a full 88 keys. This keyboard offers the real piano experience with fully weighted keys and even more additional buttons and control for the instrument browser. Any experienced musician used to a real piano will probably want to look at this range of keyboards. Unfortunately, only the MK2 series of S series keyboards are currently available with speech output. The older MK1 series is no longer supported, while the newer MK3 series does not yet have speech feedback. I will update this list accordingly as soon as the MK3 series recieves the necessary update.</td>
