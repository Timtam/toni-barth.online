# Music

Welcome to my music life! Here you can find everything related to all audio stuff that I do.

## Toni Barth Music

[My YouTube channel Toni Barth Music](https://www.youtube.com/@tonibarthmusic) took flight back in March 2022. It's the place where I post one video every week, covering all kinds of different audio-related topics like plug-ins, REAPER tips and tricks and composing, all with a focus on accessibility for visually impaired people.

## ReaPack repository

### What its all about

If you're a fan of my YouTube channel you might already know that REAPER is my goto DAW of choice for everything audio-related. 
REAPER also is highly customizable and allows you to write scripts which automate tasks in a highly flexible way. 
The VI community therefore started to write scripts long ago, and so did I. 
All of my scripts and the ones from other people within the VI community can be found within the ReaPack repository, which you can just add to your ReaPack configuration by opening REAPER and going to the Extensions menu -> ReaPack -> Import repositories... and pasting the link below in there. Confirm by pressing the OK button.

In the case that you don't know what ReaPack is all about, feel free to check it out on [the official ReaPack website](https://reapack.com/).

### Getting your own scripts into the repository

In case you've got your own scripts and want them to be added to the repository so that everyone can easily access them, feel free to reach out to me via the {{% doc %}}contact page <contact>{{% /doc %}}.

### Sponsored scripting work

In case you're missing a feature within one of my scripts or you've got an idea for a script that you think you need, but you don't have the skill to do it on your own, feel free to reach out to me {{% doc %}}via the contacts page <contact>{{% /doc %}} and pitch your idea to me. I'll get back to you and let you know if its possible to do something like that, and in case I like your idea I might take up the offer to write it. Depending on the amount of work needed, we'll probably discuss either a fixed payment rate or a donate-what-you-see-fit agreement.
