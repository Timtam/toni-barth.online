# Music

Welcome to my music life! Here you can find everything related to all audio stuff that I do.

## Toni Barth Music

[My YouTube channel Toni Barth Music](https://www.youtube.com/@tonibarthmusic) took flight back in March 2022. It's the place where I post one video every week, covering all kinds of different audio-related topics like plug-ins, REAPER tips and tricks and composing, all with a focus on accessibility for visually impaired people.
