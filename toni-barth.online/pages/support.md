# Support Me

As most of my projects are open-sourced projects or dedicated to support other people on their way to learn new skills, they are available to a large community and are required to be of good quality to be helpful to everyone. 
Creating videos or developing programs takes alot of time, and although I do this mostly because i've alot of fun doing so, it still needs to be done while working fulltime too which isn't always easy. 
I don't rely on your support, you can however buy me a coffee to make my next coding session go much smoother, or drop me a donation and reach out to me to discuss adding a new feature or create a video that you desperately want to be released soon.
You can find a list of possible financial support pages where you can send me a small donation if you really want to. Feel free to check out my {{% doc %}}contact page <contact>{{% /doc %}} and get in touch so that I know whom I have to thank for it.
